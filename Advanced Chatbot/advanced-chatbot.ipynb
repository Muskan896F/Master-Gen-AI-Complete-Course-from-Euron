    "#### What is BaseChatMessageHistory and what it does?\n",
    "BaseChatMessageHistory is what is called an **abstract base class** in Python. [See more info about this here](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_history/langchain_core.chat_history.BaseChatMessageHistory.html). This means it serves as a template or a foundational **blueprint for other classes**. It outlines a set of methods and structures that any class inheriting from it must implement or adhere to, but it cannot be used to create objects directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simpler breakdown of what it means for `BaseChatMessageHistory` to be an abstract base class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Blueprint for Other Classes:** It provides a predefined structure that other classes can follow. Think of it like an outline or a checklist for building something; it specifies what needs to be included, but it isn’t the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cannot Create Instances:** You cannot create an instance of an abstract base class. Trying to create an object directly from `BaseChatMessageHistory` would result in an error because it's meant to be a guide, not something to use directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Requires Implementation:** Any class that inherits from this abstract base class needs to implement specific methods outlined in `BaseChatMessageHistory`, such as methods for adding messages, retrieving messages, and clearing messages. The class sets the rules, and the subclasses need to follow these rules by providing the actual operational details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Purpose in Design:** Using an abstract base class helps ensure consistency and correctness in the implementation of classes that extend it. It's a way to enforce certain functionalities in any subclass, making sure that they all behave as expected without rewriting the same code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the concept of an abstract base class is about setting standards and rules, while leaving the specific details of execution to be defined by subclasses that inherit from it."

    "#### Let's explain the previous code in simple terms\n",
    "The previous code manages the chatbot's memory of conversations based on session identifiers. Here’s a breakdown of what the different components do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **chatbotMemory**:\n",
    "    - `chatbotMemory = {}`: This initializes an empty dictionary where session IDs and their respective chat histories will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **get_session_history Function**:\n",
    "    - This function, `get_session_history`, takes a `session_id` as an argument and returns the chat history associated with that session.\n",
    "    - If a chat history for the given `session_id` does not exist in `chatbotMemory`, a new instance of `ChatMessageHistory` is created and assigned to that `session_id` in the dictionary.\n",
    "    - The function ensures that each session has its own unique chat history, stored and retrieved using the session ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **chatbot_with_message_history**:\n",
    "    - `chatbot_with_message_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(chatbot, get_session_history)`: This line creates an instance of `RunnableWithMessageHistory` using two arguments: `chatbot` and `get_session_history`.\n",
    "    - The `chatbot` is passed along with the `get_session_history` function. This setup integrates the chatbot with the functionality to handle session-specific chat histories, allowing the chatbot to maintain continuity and context in conversations across different sessions.\n",
    "    - **Learn more about RunnableWithMessageHistory** [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history/).\n",
    "\n",

    "    4. **Default Behavior of limited_memory_of_messages**: Since the `lambda` function does not specify the `number_of_messages_to_keep` parameter when it calls `limited_memory_of_messages`, the latter will default to keeping the last 2 messages from the list (as defined by the earlier function).\n",
